[WIP] Visual novel game engine with a focus on customization, portability, and preformance.

The showcase for this game will likely be a release of a Doki Doki Literature Club fan title.

## Primary Goals
- Bring the power of generative dialog to games, more specifically visual novels.

Why hasn't this been done? I don't know, honestly. I think games like visual novels are perfectly suited for this.
These games have been missing AI dialog, and I believe that it will allow players to further explore a universe tailed to their gameplay.
- Speed.

RenPy is not browser friendly. This is. And this is FAST. Rust and Bevy are extremely efficient, and will allow this to be blazingly quick!.
- Self-hostability.

I like the ability to host my own game, and I think you should too. This allows you to host the entire game via Rust, and run your own private models for dialog!

## Features (see ettethread repo for the prototype!):
